# dorfromantik-solver

This project aims to create a solver for the game Dorfromantik. The solver will help players find optimal tile placements to achieve high scores and complete in-game challenges.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a tool that assists players in making strategic decisions while playing Dorfromantik. By analyzing the game board and available tiles, the solver will suggest the best possible moves to maximize the player's score and progress.

## Main Features

- Analyze the current game board and available tiles
- Suggest optimal tile placements
- Help players achieve high scores
- Assist in completing in-game challenges

## Visualization

To visualize the game map as a hexagon tiling, you can run the `src/main.py` file. This will open a Tkinter window and display the hexagon tiles representing the game map.

### Instructions

1. Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the `src/main.py` file to visualize the game map:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```
